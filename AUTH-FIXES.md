## Testing Scripts Created

1. **test-login-direct.js**
   - Tests the direct API login functionality
   - Verifies that the server-side authentication is working correctly

2. **test-client-proxy.js**
   - Tests the client-side proxy configuration
   - Ensures that the client can communicate with the server through the proxy

3. **fix-auth.js**
   - Applies all the necessary fixes to the authentication system
   - Creates a test user if it doesn't exist
   - Tests the login functionality

## How to Use

1. **Start the server**
   ```
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Start the client**
   ```
   npm run client
   ```

3. **Login with test credentials**
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: newpassword123

4. **Test protected routes**
   - Navigate to the Profile page
   - Navigate to the Dashboard page

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues with the authentication system, try the following:

1. **Clear localStorage**
   - Open the browser's developer tools
   - Go to the Application tab
   - Select Local Storage
   - Clear all items

2. **Restart both the client and server**
   - Stop both the client and server
   - Start the server first
   - Start the client second

3. **Check the console logs**
   - Open the browser's developer tools
   - Go to the Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

4. **Run the test scripts**
   - Run the test-login-direct.js script to test the direct API login
   - Run the test-client-proxy.js script to test the client-side proxy

## Next Steps

1. **Password Reset Functionality**
   - Add the ability for users to reset their passwords
   - Implement email verification for password resets

2. **Account Lockout**
   - Add account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
   - Implement a mechanism to unlock accounts

3. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Add two-factor authentication for enhanced security
   - Implement SMS or email verification
