# Recipify Project Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

Recipify is a chef's recipe and ingredient management platform designed to help professional and home chefs manage their recipes, ingredients, and kitchen inventory. This document provides a comprehensive summary of the implementation work completed, focusing on two major components:

1. Authentication System
2. CSV Batch Upload Feature

   - `restart-server.js`: Script to check if the server is running and restart if needed
   - `fix-login.js`: Script to diagnose and fix login issues
   - `reset-auth.js`: Script to bypass authentication for testing purposes

3. **Documentation**
   - `AUTH-README.md`: Documentation on how to use the authentication system
   - `IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Implementation summary
   - `AUTH-FIXES.md`: Documentation of fixes applied to the authentication system

### Features Added

4. **Validation**
   - Reusable validation rules for user input
   - Consistent error responses

5. **Testing and Utilities**

   - Utilities for user management
   - Scripts for running tests and starting the server

### NPM Scripts Added

```json
"start-secure": "node start-server.js",
"test-auth": "node run-tests.js",
"verify-auth": "node verify-auth-system.js",
"create-admin": "node create-admin.js",
"reset-password": "node reset-password.js",
"bypass-auth": "node reset-auth.js && npm run dev"

## CSV Batch Upload Feature

### Overview

We implemented a CSV batch upload feature that allows users to upload multiple ingredients at once using a CSV file, making it easier to manage ingredient inventory in bulk.

### Files Created or Modified

#### Server-side

1. **Routes**
   - `server/routes/ingredients.js`: Added endpoints for CSV template download and batch upload

2. **Configuration**
   - Added multer configuration for file uploads
   - Created uploads directory for temporary file storage

#### Files and Templates

1. **CSV Template**
   - `ingredient-template.csv`: Template file with correct column headers and example data

2. **Test Scripts**
   - `test-csv-template.js`: Script to test the CSV template download functionality
   - `test-csv-upload.js`: Script to test the CSV upload functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - `CSV-UPLOAD-README.md`: Documentation on how to use the CSV batch upload feature

### Features Added

1. **CSV Template Download**
   - Endpoint to download a pre-formatted CSV template
   - Public test route for easier testing

2. **Batch Upload**
   - Endpoint to upload multiple ingredients at once
   - Validation of required fields and data formats
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Success tracking

3. **File Handling**
   - Secure file upload with type checking
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
   - Size limits to prevent abuse

### API Endpoints

1. **Template Download**
   - `GET /api/ingredients/template`: Download the CSV template (requires authentication)
   - `GET /api/ingredients/test-template`: Download the CSV template (public, for testing)

2. **Batch Upload**
   - `POST /api/ingredients/upload`: Upload a CSV file for batch processing (requires authentication)

### NPM Scripts Added

```json
"test-csv-upload": "node test-csv-upload.js",
"test-csv-template": "node test-csv-template.js"
```

## How to Use
