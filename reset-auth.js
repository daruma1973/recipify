console.log('Authentication has been temporarily bypassed for development.');
console.log('\nWhat has been changed:');
console.log('1. PrivateRoute now allows access without authentication');
console.log('2. Login component bypasses actual authentication');
console.log('3. AuthState provides mock user data without API calls');
console.log('\nTo use the application:');
console.log('1. Start the server: npm run server');
console.log('2. Start the client: npm run client');
console.log('3. Login with any credentials - they will be ignored');
console.log('4. You will be automatically logged in as "Development User"');
console.log('\nTo restore authentication later:');
console.log('1. Revert the changes to PrivateRoute.js, Login.js, and AuthState.js');
console.log('2. Or restore from version control if available');
console.log('\n=== HAPPY DEVELOPMENT! ===');

// This script doesn't need to do anything else - the authentication bypass
// is implemented in the React components
