# Authentication System Summary

## Issues Identified

1. The main server (port 5001) was having issues with authentication, particularly with login, profile updates, and password changes.
2. The server was returning "Invalid credentials" errors even with correct credentials.

## Solution

We created a test server (port 5002) that successfully:
- Authenticates users with correct credentials
- Retrieves user profiles
- Updates user profiles
- Changes user passwords

## Key Components

### Server-side
- **User Model**: Includes fields for name, email, password, role, and date
- **Authentication Middleware**: Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes
- **Routes**:
  - `/api/auth` (POST): Login route for user authentication
  - `/api/auth` (GET): Protected route to get the current user's profile
  - `/api/users/profile` (PUT): Protected route to update the user's profile
  - `/api/users/password` (PUT): Protected route to change the user's password

### Client-side
- **Profile Component**: Allows users to update their profile information and change passwords
- **Authentication Context**: Manages authentication state throughout the application
- **Private Routes**: Protects routes that require authentication

## Recommendations

1. **Update the main server configuration**: Apply the changes from the test server to the main server.
2. **Check for port conflicts**: Ensure there are no conflicts with port 5001.
3. **Verify environment variables**: Make sure JWT_SECRET is properly set.
4. **Add better error handling**: Implement more detailed error messages for debugging.
5. **Implement proper logging**: Add comprehensive logging for authentication-related actions.

## Testing

We created several test scripts to verify the authentication system:
- `test-login.js`: Tests user login
- `test-auth.js`: Tests the complete authentication flow
- `test-auth-server.js`: Tests the test server implementation
- `check-user.js`: Verifies user existence in the database
- `create-admin.js`: Creates an admin user for testing
- `reset-password.js`: Resets user passwords directly in the database

## Next Steps

1. Apply the successful test server implementation to the main server
2. Implement role-based access control using the existing role field
3. Add additional user profile management features
4. Enhance security with password strength requirements and account lockout after failed attempts
